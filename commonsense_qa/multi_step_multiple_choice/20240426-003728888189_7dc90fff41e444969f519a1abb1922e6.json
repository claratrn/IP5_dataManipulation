            "question": "Before getting a divorce, what did the wife feel who was doing all the work?\nChoices:\nA: harder\nB: anguish\nC: bitterness\nD: tears\nE: sadness",
            "answer": "Step 1: We need to understand the key information in the question and use process of elimination. The question tells us that \"the wife was doing all the work\" and we need to determine how she felt before getting a divorce. Starting with A: \"harder\" doesn't make much sense in this context, so we can eliminate it. Confidence: 80%\n\nStep 2: Moving on to B: \"anguish,\" this could be a possibility because if the wife was doing all the work, she may have been overwhelmed and stressed. However, we don't have enough information to confidently choose this option. Confidence: 60%\n\nStep 3: Next, C: \"bitterness\" could also be a possibility because if the wife was doing all the work and wasn't feeling appreciated, she may have developed bitterness towards her husband. However, we still don't have enough information to confidently choose this option. Confidence: 60%\n\nStep 4: Moving on to \"tears,\" option D, again, we don't have enough information to confidently choose this answer. Confidence: 60%\n\nStep 5: Finally, E: \"sadness\" could be a possibility, as it's common to feel sad when going through a difficult time like a divorce. Since this seems to be the most plausible answer among the choices given, we will go with option E. Confidence: 80%\n\nThe final answer is E: \"sadness\" with a confidence level of 80%.",

            "answer": "Step 1: Johnny is relaxing, so he\u2019s likely not at the gym. Eliminate D. Confidence: 30%\n\nStep 2: Johnny is sitting on a bench, so he\u2019s not at a bus depot or a rest area. Eliminate B and E. Confidence: 60%\n\nStep 3: Since Johnny is relaxing, he could be at a state park or a garden. However, the fact that he is doing work on his hobby implies that he is at a place where he can pursue his hobby- which is more likely in a garden than a state park. Choose C. Confidence: 80%\n\nThe final answer is C: garden, with a confidence level of 80%.",

            "answer": "Step 1: James was cooling off too quickly, implying that he was losing heat rapidly rather than gaining it, thus option A: loss of heat is a logical answer. Confidence: 80%\n\nStep 2: Revenge, expansion, and relaxation seem to have no connection with James' situation. Calming down could have some relation but it is too vague to be a correct answer. Thus, options B, C, D, and E can be eliminated. Confidence: 90%.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the correct answer is A: loss of heat. Confidence: 95%.\n\nThe final answer is A: loss of heat, with a confidence level of 95%.",

            "answer": "Step 1: The text mentions that it was \"his favorite\" room, which means he must have liked it for a specific reason. The reason is that \"the aromas always drew him to\" this room. So we are looking for a room in which aromatic things are present. Confidence: 80%\n\nStep 2: The options are yard, basement, kitchen, living room, and garden. The yard doesn't usually have many aromas and is not typically inside the house. The basement is not where people usually spend a lot of time, and it's not where aromas are typically found. While gardens can have some aromas, the text says \"room\" which would indicate that it's an indoor location. The living room might have some aromas, but generally the activities that happen in the living room aren't ones that involve aromatics. The kitchen, however, is where food is prepared, and therefore where aromas are likely to originate, making it the most likely option. Confidence: 90%\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the answer is C: kitchen. Confidence: 95%\n\nThe final answer is C: kitchen, with a confidence level of 95%.",

            "answer": "Step 1: Let's eliminate the options that do not make any sense. Option A: Hospital, we go there to seek treatment, not to contract illness. Option B: Head, it is a body part, it cannot contract anything. Option E: Doctor's office, it is a place where we go to seek medical attention and not to contract illness. So the most probable options are C and D. Confidence: 60%\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze option C: Sick person. It is highly likely that a sick person would contract an illness. Confidence: 75%\n\nStep 3: Let's analyze option D: Elderly person. Elderly people usually have a weaker immune system and therefore may have a higher risk of contracting illnesses.

The choices are Chicago, street, Little Italy, food court, and capital cities. Confidence: 100%\n\nStep 2: We can immediately eliminate options A and E since they are not specific locations, and the question is asking for a location. Confidence: 100%\n\nStep 3: Option B, street, is too broad and could be anywhere. It's unlikely to find a pizzeria on any random street while shopping. Confidence: 80%\n\nStep 4: Option D, the food court, is a possible location where you can find multiple food vendors, including pizzerias. The food court is often situated in the shopping mall or the shopping center. So, it is a good option. Confidence: 90%\n\nStep 5: Option C, Little Italy, is a neighborhood in many cities known for its authentic Italian food, including pizzerias.
