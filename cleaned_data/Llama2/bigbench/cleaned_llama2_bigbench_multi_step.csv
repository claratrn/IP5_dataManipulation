Step 1:
Jane says May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to her. This means that the date she considers as ""yesterday"" is the date that is closest to the current date.

Confidence: 80%

Step 2:
If May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, then the date that is one week ago from today must be the date that is furthest away from May 6, 1992.

Confidence: 60%

Step 3:
We can calculate the date one week ago from today by subtracting one week from the current date.

Date one week ago: May 30, 1992

Confidence: 70%

Step 4:
Jane says that May 6, 1992 is ten years ago. This means that the date ten years ago must be the date that is ten years before the current date.

Date ten years ago: May 30, 1982

Confidence: 80%

Step 5:
We can now calculate the date one week ago from the date ten years ago by subtracting one week from the date ten years ago.
