20,"A city ordinance provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to litter in a public park, and that a violation of this ordinance shall be punished by a fine of not more than $100 or imprisonment for not more than 30 days. A protestor organized a demonstration against federal governmental support to rebels in a foreign country. The rally took place in a city park, and attracted about 100 supporters. During the rally, the protestor delivered a speech to the attendees. At the conclusion of his speech, the protestor said, ""I'm sick and tired of the garbage this administration is getting away with. Here's what I think about its policy of rebel aid . . . "" At which point, the protestor walked over to a trash can and dumped its contents on the ground. As the crowd cheered wildly, the protestor shouted, ""No more rebel aid . . . let's stop this garbage now!"" After littering the park, the protestor and his supporters left without picking up the trash. As a matter of constitutional law, may the protestor be prosecuted under the aforementioned city ordinance for littering the public park?
Choices:
0. No, because littering the park in these circumstances could be construed as symbolic speech and, thus, it is protected from government regulation by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
1. No, because the facts do not indicate that the protestor's actions presented a clear and present danger that was likely to produce or incite imminent lawless action, thereby necessitating an abridgment of his freedom of speech.
2. Yes, because the city ordinance advances an important and legitimate public interest and is not directed at the suppression of communication.
3. Yes, because littering the park is conduct, not speech and, therefore, it may not be treated by the law as communication.","‘Explanation: The question is asking us whether the protestor can be prosecuted under the city ordinance for littering the public park under the circumstances mentioned. According to the given facts, the protestor dumped trash on the ground, and his supporters left without picking up the trash. Therefore the protestor is most likely guilty of littering in the public park. Additionally, the fact that the protest included the speech suggests that this could be a possible First Amendment issue. However, the First Amendment does not protect conduct that serves no expressive purpose and violates a valid law. Although the protestor's conduct was accompanied by speech, that speech do not protect him from the consequences of littering.

The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it.

0. the leasehold contract was void ab initio.
1. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
2. the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
3. the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.","Explanation: 
As the original three-year term had already expired and the student was paying rent on a monthly basis, it would be considered a periodic tenancy. Therefore, the landlord would have to give requisite notice to terminate it. The notice period would be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where the property is located.

26,"A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?
Choices:
0. No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
1. No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

2. Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.
3. Yes, the seller has strict liability to the buyer for any defects that arise within one year of the sale.","Explanation:
The case seems to focus on the issue of warranties in a contract of sale for newly built homes. Warranty is a promise or assurance given by the seller to the buyer that certain facts, conditions or characteristics about the item being sold are true or will remain true in the future. There are two types of warranties, express (written or oral statements by the seller about the product) and implied (warranties presumed by the law to exist in certain transactions). 

In this case, the buyer signed a contract to purchase a newly built home from the builder-seller. However, after paying the sale price and taking occupancy, the buyer experienced drainage and interior flooding problems with the home. The city also issued citations against the owner for not following code regulations regarding construction on a flood-prone slope. 

The buyer asked the seller to repair all of the defects at his own expense but the seller refused. The buyer brought an action in court alleging breach of warranty against the builder-seller. 

Option 0: No, the buyer had an obligation to make a full inspection and discover any defects prior to paying the full price and taking occupancy.
This statement is incorrect. Generally, in a contract of sale of newly built homes, the seller has an implied warranty that the home is built in a good and workmanlike manner and is fit for its intended purpose. The obligation for the buyer to inspect and discover defects is not absolute, and is limited by the principle of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) and the reasonableness of the buyer's actions. 

Option 1: No, the law regarding a building purchase is based on the premise ""Let the buyer beware.""
This statement is incorrect. The principle of caveat emptor is not absolute, and is limited by the implied warranty of good workmanship and fitness for intended use that exists in a contract of sale for newly built homes. 

Option 2: Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.
This statement is correct. Generally, in a contract of sale of newly built homes, the seller has an implied warranty that the home is built in a good and workmanlike manner and is fit for its intended purpose. The buyer can therefore bring an action for breach of warranty against the seller. 

Option 3: Yes, the seller has strict liability to the buyer for any defects that arise within one year of the sale.
This statement is incorrect. Strict liability means that a party is liable for harm caused by their actions or products, regardless of fault or intent. However, in a contract of sale for newly built homes, the seller's liability for defects is limited to breach of warranty.

Since the worker was injured in California where state law generally allows punitive damages, it is important to determine whether California law or Washington law should apply with respect to punitive damages. The case was filed in a federal district court in Washington, which is not the state where the accident occurred. When federal courts hear cases that arise under state law, the court generally applies the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. In Washington, courts apply the ""most significant relationship"" test, which examines the following factors: (1) the place of injury, (2) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (3) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and (4) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered. 
As per the question, the plaintiff is alleging she is entitled to punitive damages in her federal lawsuit filed in Washington, which does not generally allow punitive damages. Therefore, even if the ""place of injury"" factor would suggest that California law should apply, the other factors would not necessarily support such a conclusion.

312,"After months of negotiations, the United States and Canada entered into a tax treaty that provided that neither country would impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation. The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis that may be urged in support of this claim?
Choices:
0. The President's unilateral termination of a treaty benefiting residents of the United States cannot be effective until a hearing is afforded to persons who would be affected by such action.
1. The courts have exclusive authority to determine whether a particular treaty has, in fact, been breached by another nation.
2. A ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and, therefore, remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute.
3. The treaty created a property right in Canadian citizens residing in the United States that cannot be taken away without just compensation.","Explanation: 
- The U.S. citizen residing in Canada during the baseball season was convicted of illegally evading payment of Canadian income taxes which is a false act to the treaty.
- The President's announcement that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States cannot abrogate a ratified treaty without legal procedure which is a constitutional basis.
- As per the constitution of the United States, ""...all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding"" (U.S. Const. art.

The only information provided was a general notice from the city declaring a new policy on massage parlors that had to be rapidly instituted for the welfare of the community. She sued the city in federal court, claiming that her business had been taken without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause.

0. Yes, because there is no right to earning a living under the substantive due process clause.

3. There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.","Explanation: 

1. The writer sent a four-page synopsis of an idea for a new television series to a Hollywood producer in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication.

3. The assistant responded by saying, ""Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work.""

In order to finance the purchase of the property in 2005, the landowner borrowed $100,000 from the bank, which secured the loan with a mortgage that amortized principal and interest payments over a 15-year period. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage.

If the mother sues the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son, will the mother be likely to prevail?
Choices:
0. No, because a person has no right to privacy after his or her death.
1. No, because the street was open to the public and the subject was newsworthy.

1. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.
2. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.
3. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.","Explanation: 

The issue in this case is determining when the delivery of the deed conveying the quarry to the niece took place and whether the niece had ownership of the quarry at the time of the widower's death. 

Option 0: There is no evidence of a ""causa mortis"" gift because the deed was not given in contemplation of death, and the widower did not die until one month later. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option 1: The delivery of the deed to the friend may have been symbolic, but it was not effective because the friend did not deliver it to the niece. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

Option 2: The friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office, which is a form of constructive delivery and creates a presumption of delivery to the grantee. Therefore, this option is a plausible answer because delivery was likely effective when the friend recorded the deed.

671,"A 15-year-old boy was sledding down a pathway through a wooded area of land owned by a woman. The boy had frequently used the pathway for sledding in the previous months. The path, made of concrete, led through the woods from a public highway to a pond in the rear of the woman's property. The pathway was used for sledding and the pond for skating by the residents of the neighboring areas, without the consent of the woman. Furthermore, the woman failed to post any signs forbidding trespassing. After the boy had been sledding down the pathway for approximately three hours one morning, he lost control of the sled, and steered it into a tree. The boy suffered serious injuries in the crash.

The doctrine of attractive nuisance applies to the condition that may cause harm to children who may be unable to recognize the danger posed by the condition, and the condition must be reasonably supposed to attract a child in such a way to bring harm to that child. Although there is no mention of the existence of a dangerous condition or an object that could have easily attracted the attention of the child, it can be inferred that the pathway and the pond were attractive conditions for children.

708,"A man owned a piece of land with a run-down log cabin on it. He lost interest in it, letting tax bills pile up and failing to maintain it. In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?
Choices:
0. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.
1. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.
2. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.
3. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.","Explanation: Adverse possession is the legal concept that allows a person to claim ownership of property without actually purchasing it. To establish adverse possession, a person must show that they possessed the property for a certain period of time, usually 20 years, and that their possession was open, hostile, exclusive, and continuous. In this case, the homeless couple possessed the property for over 20 years, so the first choice is a possible answer.

1197,"A vehicle operator was driving on a highway at night. His girlfriend was in the passenger seat. They were returning from a college night class. She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by ""smoking weed"" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?
Choices:
0. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.
1. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.
2. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.
3. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.","""Explanation: In this case, the operator's claim is based on contributory negligence. We need to see whether or not the passenger's behavior can be cited as a fault factor in the accident. It's important to look at the joint enterprise principle: did the passenger have a ""common purpose"" with the driver, and was she actively involved in it? Sharing a car doesn't automatically result in a joint enterprise situation. Was smoking weed merely a distraction, or did it cause or contribute to the crash? Smoking marijuana is illegal, which could lead to negligence per se, but that doesn't mean the court will automatically find that the act was inherently related to the accident.

S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to ""dirty tricks"" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely

1217,"A store owner noticed that an expensive electronic device was missing from the store. He assumed that a shoplifter had taken it. Later that day, the store owner was cleaning up the small room in the back of the store that the employees of the store used to store their personal items while they were at work. The store owner was straightening up the coat rack in the back room, when he accidentally knocked one of the employee's coats off the hanger. As the coat fell onto the floor, the missing electronic device fell out of the pocket of the coat. It was still in its original packaging, and the store owner checked the serial number on the package to confirm that it was the device missing from the store's shelves. The store owner knew that the coat belonged to a woman who worked as a cashier in the store. The store owner felt bad, but decided that he had no choice but to call the police. Two police officers arrived at the store. They gathered information from the store owner, who signed a criminal complaint against the woman. The officers then discussed the matter with the woman. Although she denied stealing anything, the officers arrested her and informed her that they would need to take her to the police station. After the police took the woman away, another employee of the store found out that the woman had been arrested. That employee immediately went to the store owner and admitted that he was actually the one who had stolen the device, and that he had hidden it in the woman's coat, intending to retrieve it later before the end of the woman's work shift. The store owner promptly called the police and told them that there had been a mistake and that the theft charge against the woman was invalid. The police released the woman, who spent a total of approximately 30 minutes in police custody. If the woman asserts a claim for false imprisonment against the arresting officers, will the woman prevail?
Choices:
0. Yes, because the woman had not committed a crime at the time she was arrested.
1. Yes, because the woman was arrested and held in custody.
2. No, because the woman was detained for only 30 minutes.

No, because the officers had probable cause to arrest the woman based on the store owner's complaint and honest belief that the woman had stolen the device.","Explanation: The woman may prevail in her claim for false imprisonment if she can prove that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest her.

""A defendant was a lawyer who worked in a law firm located in the state.

The defendant donned a cowboy mask and entered the senior partner's office.

1498,"After a severe thunderstorm had struck the area, a homeowner discovered that her roof had suffered extensive damage. She telephoned a roofer to inquire about having the necessary repairs done to her roof. The roofer agreed to finish the work within 30 days, and the homeowner promised to pay$10,000. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
Choices:
0. The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.
1. The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.
2. The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.
3. The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.","Explanation: 
This question is related to Contracts law. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable legal obligations. Contracts can be formed orally or in writing. To analyze this question, we need to determine the type of contract formed between the homeowner and the roofer, the obligations of each party, and the conditions that govern the performance of these obligations.

The roofer agreed to finish the repairs within 30 days, and the homeowner promised to pay $10,000. This agreement creates mutual obligations, where the roofer has to perform the repairs, and the homeowner has to pay for the repairs. 

Option 0: A constructive condition precedent is a condition implied in a contract that must be fulfilled by one party before the other party is obligated to perform. However, in this case, the roofer is obligated to perform the repairs within 30 days, and the homeowner is obligated to pay $10,000. Therefore, option 0 is incorrect.

Option 1: A condition subsequent is a condition that terminates a party's duty to perform if the condition occurs. However, in this case, there is no implied condition subsequent. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

Option 2: In constructive concurrent conditions, both parties have duties to perform simultaneously. However, in this case, the roofer is obligated to perform the repairs within 30 days, and the homeowner is obligated to pay $10,000. Therefore, option 2 is incorrect.

Option 3: The fact that the contract was oral does not render it unenforceable. However, the enforceability of an oral contract may depend on whether the contract falls under the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds requires that certain types of contracts be in writing, such as contracts for the sale of land. In this case, the contract is for repairs to a house, not the sale of land. Therefore, option 3 is incorrect.

1. Yes, the police overreached by not having him mentally evaluated before questioning him.

The physician verified that he was suffering from hallucinations.
