For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:""It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. """"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract.

3. the homeowner did not receive notice of cancellation.","By thinking step by step and evaluating each choice:
0. Although she failed to make the last two premium payments, there was a bargained-for exchange - This choice is not a valid theory for recovery because the homeowner clearly failed to fulfill her promise to make the payments.
0. The insurance company's duty to pay was not expressly conditioned on the homeowner's duty to make the payments - This choice is incorrect because the policy explicitly states that the homeowner promised to pay a quarterly premium for the insurance company's promise to pay up to $500,000 in the event of fire damage.
1. The insurance company was under an independent duty to pay for the loss - This choice is also incorrect because the contract between the homeowner and the insurance company specifically conditioned the insurance company's duty to pay on the homeowner's completion of the agreed-upon payments.
2. The homeowner did not receive notice of cancellation - This choice is not relevant because the scenario does not mention any cancellation of the insurance policy.
Therefore, the best theory for recovery is that the homeowner failed to make the last two premium payments as promised by the contract, and therefore the insurance company had no obligation to pay for the loss of the house.

647,"An orange grove and a vineyard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the orange grove, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the vineyard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $200,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the orange grove. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that the orange grove abuts a public highway. The only access to that public highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove. If the investor initiates an appropriate action to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, she should

0. prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.

2. not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.
3. not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.","To determine the answer, we must consider the legal doctrine of easements and review the facts of the case. 

An easement is a non-possessory right to use someone else's property for a specific purpose. In this case, the shepherd was granted a right-of-way easement across the orange grove, which was recorded and created an easement appurtenant to the vineyard.

When the farmer acquired the vineyard from the rancher, he obtained ownership of the easement as well. However, when he conveyed the vineyard to the investor, he did not include any reference to the easement for right-of-way. 

Now, the investor is claiming that she has a right-of-way easement across the orange grove. 

Let's evaluate each choice:

0. prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor. - There is no evidence to suggest that an easement by implication arose from the conveyance. The investor did not have prior use of the right-of-way and it was not mentioned in the deed.
0. prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released. - This statement is generally true for easements, but it does not apply in this case because the investor did not acquire the right-of-way through the recording of a new easement.
1. not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard. - This statement is also incorrect because an easement appurtenant runs with the land and is not extinguished by merger or acquisition of a fee simple estate.
2. not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way. - This statement accurately reflects the fact that the investor did not obtain the right-of-way through the conveyance of the vineyard.

Based on our analysis, the correct answer is 4: not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.

In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that ""in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. "" In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the investor sold 50 residential lots to individual purchasers.

0. the buyer, because his own deed made no mention of the subdivision. - This choice may be correct, but it does not address whether there was a valid dedication.

0. the buyer, because the dedication was not made to the public in general. - This choice assumes there was a dedication, but it is not clear if one exists.

1276,"A hotel guest suffered personal injuries from a fire started by an arsonist. The hotel had no sprinkler systems or smoke detectors. After settling with the hotel, the guest sued the manufacturer of the carpet that was in her room and elsewhere in the hotel. The carpet caused the fire to spread rapidly due to its easy flammability. Evidence proved that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. How did the trial court most likely rule on that issue?

0. The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.

It is possible, however, that the manufacturer's knowledge of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures could be a contributing factor and thus leave some liability on the manufacturer.

0. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability - This choice seems unlikely, as the concept of superseding cause would generally be considered in this type of case.

1. The intervening causes were irrelevant due to the strict liability of the manufacturer - Strict liability may be applicable to products liability cases, but it is not directly relevant to the issue of superseding cause.

2. By not suing the arsonist first, the guest waived her right to sue the manufacturer - This choice is not likely to be correct as there is no general requirement to sue parties in a specific order, and the arsonist may not have the financial resources to satisfy any judgment.

1295,"A landowner, her aunt, and her brother are the owners of three contiguous lots. A downward slope exists from the landowner's land to the brother'sland. The aunt, the owner in the middle of the three lots, was an amateur scientist. She began experimentation with electricity, using a lightning rod to conduct her experiments. Frequently, the electrical storms apparently originated in and over the area within which the brother's land is located. Because of this, the aunt would often angle her rod over the fence between her property and the brother's property to maximize her chances of success. After one entire rainy and windy season of experiments, the brother had grown tired of the aunt's lightning-rod intrusions because they interfered with his ham radio operations in his garage.

1298,"A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?
Choices:
0. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.
1. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.

0. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use. - This choice is also incorrect because under the common law of riparian rights, neither domestic use nor agricultural use has superiority over the other.

1. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need. - This choice is incorrect as the millionaire did not obtain an easement. Easements are granted by the landowner, but here the millionaire has been using the water without the permission of the rancher.

2. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water. - This choice is the correct answer as the common law of riparian rights gives priority to the party who has continuously used the water and put it to a beneficial use before the other party started using it.
