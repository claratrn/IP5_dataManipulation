What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?,"To find the date of today, we need to determine which month Jane's 5th visit falls in. If we count the number of months from October 2009 to the current month, we can determine this. 

Starting from October 2009, Jane's 5th visit to the bookstore would have been in February 2010 (October 16, 2009 -> November 16, 2009 -> December 16, 2009 -> January 16, 2010 -> February 16, 2010). 

Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, we know that today's date is after February 16, 2010. We can determine the current year by looking at the number of times Jane has visited the bookstore since February 16, 2010. If we add 12 months for each subsequent year, we can determine the current year. 

Since it is Jane's 5th visit to the bookstore, we can add 4 * 12 = 48 months to February 16, 2010 to get the current month and year.

Therefore, we can find the date of her next visit by adding 16 to the current month (which is May) and then adjusting for when we roll over into the next year or go past December (e.g., if we're currently in November and add 16, we would need to show December 16th of the same year).

Since it's her 5th visit, we know she has already been to the bookstore in October 2009, February 2010, June 2010, and October 2010.

Thus, the date of her next visit can be found by adding 16 months to October 2010, which is February 2012. Therefore, the date tomorrow (assuming tomorrow is her next visit) would be 02/16/2012.

333,"Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?","We can start by adding 5 years to the year 1958 to find the year of their 5-year anniversary. 

1958 + 5 = 1963

Therefore, their 5-year anniversary was on Jan 2, 1963. 

Now, to find today's date, we need to add the number of days from Jan 2, 1963 to today's date. 

First, we need to find the number of leap years between 1963 and the current year. 

There are 16 leap years between 1963 and 2021 (1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020).

Next, we need to calculate the number of days from Jan 2 to Dec 31 in the year of their anniversary. 

Days from Jan 2 to Dec 31 = 365 - 2 = 363

Then, we add the number of days in the remaining years (from 1964 to 2021). 

Days = (2020-1964)*365 + 16 

We add all of these days together: 

Days = 363 + 223,240 + 1 = 223,604

Finally, we add these days to Jan 2, 1963: 

Jan 2, 1963 + 223,604 days = Oct 23, 2021

Therefore, the date today is 10/23/2021.

Using a calendar or any date calculator, we can subtract 1 day from Jan 2, 1963, which gives us:

Jan 1, 1963

May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 31 days. So, May has 22 days left, June has 30 days, and July has 8 days before August 9th, 2017.
