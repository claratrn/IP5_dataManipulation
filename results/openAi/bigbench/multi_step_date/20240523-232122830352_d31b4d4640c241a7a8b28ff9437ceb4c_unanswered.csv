Step 4: October has 31 days, so the first Thursday is either the 4th or the 5th of October. We need to go back three more Thursdays to get to the fourth Thursday. 
Confidence: 80%

Step 5: Three Thursdays before the fourth Thursday of October is the first Thursday of October. If the first Thursday is the 4th, then the fourth Thursday is the 25th. If the first Thursday is the 5th, then the fourth Thursday is the 26th. 
Confidence: 70%

Step 6: We need to determine whether the first Thursday of October is the 4th or the 5th. We know that Thanksgiving is always after the 21st of November and before or on the 28th.
