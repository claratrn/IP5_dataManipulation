104,2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Explanation: 
One year ago from today is simply subtracting 1 from the current year. As we don't have the current date, we can't directly subtract 1 year. Therefore, we need to work around this by adding 1 year to the given date. Then, we can subtract 1 year from it to get the final answer.

Adding 1 year to the current year (denoted by YYYY) would give us: YYYY + 1
Now, to subtract 1 year from the given date (MM/DD/YYYY), we would need to subtract 1 from both MM and DD while keeping YYYY + 1 as the year.

Therefore, the date one year ago would be: MM - 1 / DD - 1 / YYYY + 1 - 1

Since we don't know the current month and day, we can't provide the complete date. Instead, we can just give the year that we arrived at, which is 2014.

162,"Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Explanation: 

A meteor shower occurs on specific days of the year. Therefore, we can use the fact that Jane sees a meteor shower for the second time in the year to determine the possible dates.

Meteor showers occur on the following dates:

- Quadrantids: January 3-4
- Lyrids: April 21-22
- Perseids: August 11-13
- Orionids: October 20-21
- Leonids: November 17-18
- Geminids: December 13-14

Since the date is after April 21st (Jane has already seen the Lyrids), the only possible meteor shower is the Perseids, which occurs on August 11-13.

Therefore, the date today is either 8/11, 8/12, or 8/13.

165,"Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?","Explanation: 

To calculate the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date which is 3/5 in this case. 

First, we need to determine the month and day Jane saw the meteor shower for the first time in 1973. Since she is seeing it for the second time this year, we can assume that she saw it around the same time last year which was 1972. 

We do not have any information about the exact date, so we can make an assumption that she saw it around the same time as today's date in 1972. We know that today is 3/5, so we can assume that she saw the meteor shower around the beginning of March in 1972. 

Therefore, the first time Jane saw the meteor shower in 1973 was most likely around the beginning of March as well. 

Now, we can subtract 10 days from 3/5: 

3/5 - 10 days = 2/23/1973

167,"Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Explanation: 

- One year ago from today is 3/5/YYYY-1.
- In order to deduce the year, we need to count how many times Jane has seen the meteor shower since 1973.
- Since this is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower this year, she must have seen it once before. Therefore, the year must be 1973.
