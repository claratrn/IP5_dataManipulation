256,The current local time is 3:02 pm of 5/4/2004. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?,"Explanation: 
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the current date. We must first account for the fact that the number of days in each month varies. 

1. Recall that the current date is 5/4/2004 at 3:02 pm. 

2. We subtract one month from the current month of May to obtain April. Therefore, the month a month ago was April. 

3. Now, we need to consider how many days to subtract from April 4, 2004, to get to the date a month ago. We subtract the number of days in May (31) from April 4 to give us April 4 minus 31 days, which is March 4.

337,"Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?","Explanation: 

Their 5-year anniversary is on Jan 2, 1963. To determine the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from Jan 2, 1963. However, since Feb only has 28 or 29 days, we need to consider the number of days in the month.

Since it is not specified whether we should consider a leap year, we will assume it is not a leap year.

Jan has 31 days, so Feb will have 28 days. Subtracting 28 days from Jan 2, 1963, we get:

Jan 2, 1963 - 28 days = <b>Dec 5, 1962</b>

Final Answer is: <b>12/5/1962</b>, With a Confidence of <b>100%</b>","Explanation:

349,"On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?","Explanation: 

Since Jane ate an egg per day after May 9th, 2017, she ate 7 eggs in a week.
