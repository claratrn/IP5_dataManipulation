C: might fall - Skating involves gliding on ice or a skateboard, and falling is a possibility. However, fear of falling is not the only reason why skaters might experience fear. Other factors, such as performance anxiety or fear of failure, can also contribute to fear in skating.

D: can't stop - Skating involves movement and momentum, and stopping can be challenging. However, fear of not being able to stop is not the only reason why skaters might experience fear. Other factors, such as fear of falling or fear of the unknown, can also cause fear in skating.
