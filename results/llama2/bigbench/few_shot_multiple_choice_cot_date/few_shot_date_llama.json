      "answer": "  \"Explanation:\n\nStep 1: Given that today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower, we can deduce that the current date is 3/5 in 1973.\n\nStep 2: To find out the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY, we need to determine what date follows 3/5 in 1973. Since 3/5 is already in the middle of the month, we can deduce that the date a month ago would be the last day of the previous month.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating each choice, we can determine that the last day of February in 1973 is 02/28/1973.\n\nFinal Answer: 02/28/1973, With a Confidence Level of 90%\n\nNote: The confidence level is an estimate of how certain I am that the answer is correct, based on the analysis and reasoning provided.
