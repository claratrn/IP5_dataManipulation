            "answer": "  Great, let's solve this problem!\n\nThe question states that Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, and today is her 16-year-old birthday. To find the date one year ago from today, we can use the following formula:\n\nOne year ago = Today's date - 1 year\n\nSo, we can substitute today's date (which we can find from the question) into the formula:\n\nOne year ago = February 28, 2023 - 1 year\n\nNow, let's solve for the date one year ago:\n\nOne year ago = February 28, 2023 - 1 year = February 28, 2022\n\nTherefore, the final answer is February 28, 2022, with a confidence level of 95% (based on the information provided in the question).\n\nThe answer can be written in the format you requested:\n\nThe final answer is February 28, 2022, with a confidence level of 95% (based on the information provided in the question).",

            "answer": "  Great, let's solve this problem!\n\nQuestion: Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?\n\nAnswer: The final answer is 3/4, with a confidence level of 90% (i.e., 90-100%).\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n* Today is 3/5, which means it's March 5th.\n* Jane has seen a meteor shower twice in the year 1973. This means that the meteor shower occurred on two different dates in 1973.\n\nNow, let's find the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY. Since Jane saw the meteor shower twice in 1973, the meteor shower must have occurred on two different dates. Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY is 3/4.\n\nConfidence level: 90% (i.e., 90-100%) because the information provided is consistent with the answer.",
